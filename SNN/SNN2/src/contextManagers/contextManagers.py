Context Managers Module
=======================

This module provides context managers and utilities for timing code execution
and handling augmented class names within the SNN2 framework.

The module contains both function-based and class-based context managers that
can be used to measure execution times of code blocks, with optional logging
support. These tools are essential for performance monitoring and profiling
in neural network training and data processing pipelines.

Functions
---------
get_realName : function
    Extract the real name from objects, handling augmented classes.
timeit_cnt : contextmanager
    Context manager for timing code execution with logging support.

Classes
-------
TimeitContext : class
    Reusable context manager for collecting timing statistics across multiple runs.

Examples
--------
Basic timing with logging:

>>> with timeit_cnt("data_processing"):
...     # Some data processing code
...     process_data()
data_processing execution time: 1234.567 ms

Reusable timing context:

>>> timer = TimeitContext()
>>> for i in range(3):
...     with timer():
...         time.sleep(0.1)
>>> print(f"Mean execution time: {timer.mean:.3f}s")
Mean execution time: 0.100s

Notes
-----
This module integrates with the SNN2 logging system through the f_logger
decorator, providing consistent logging behavior across the framework.
All timing measurements are performed using Python's time.time() function
for high-resolution timing.

def get_realName(obj: Any):

    Get the real name of an object, handling augmented classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : Any
        The object whose real name should be retrieved.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The real name of the object. If the object is an augmented class
        with a custom name, returns the passed name, otherwise returns
        the qualified name.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is designed to handle special cases where objects
    have been augmented and their original name has been stored in
    a `c_passed_name` attribute.

    """
    Context manager for timing code execution with logging support.

    This context manager measures the execution time of a code block
    and optionally logs the result using the provided logger.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name identifier for the timed operation, used in log messages.
    *args : tuple
        Variable length argument list (not used in current implementation).
    active : bool, default=True
        Whether to actively log and print timing results.
    **kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments containing logger and write_msg from f_logger decorator.

    Yields
    ------
    None
        Control is yielded to the code block being timed.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is decorated with @f_logger which automatically provides
    logger and write_msg in kwargs. The timing results are both logged
    and printed to stdout when active=True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> with timeit_cnt("my_operation"):
    ...     # Some time-consuming operation
    ...     time.sleep(1)
